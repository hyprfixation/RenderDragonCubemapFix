# RenderDragonCubemapFix
a custom shader for the MCBE RenderDragon engine that fixes the cubemap position for parity with optifine cubemaps on java edition.

you are free to use, edit and distrubute this code, just please credit me and others who have helped me with the code.

this is uh just a mirror of the shader for 1.21.20+ since furzide is lazy
