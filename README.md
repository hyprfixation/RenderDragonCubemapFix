# RenderDragonCubemapFix
a custom shader for the MCBE RenderDragon engine that fixes the cubemap position for parity with optifine cubemaps on java edition.

you are free to use, edit and distrubute this code, just please credit me and others who have helped me with the code.

this is uh just a mirror of the shader updated to 1.21.20+ since furzide is lazy
real stuff though I don't know if material updater works for iOS and Android but i don't feel like testing it rn soo you get windows :3
